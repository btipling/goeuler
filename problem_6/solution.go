	Problem:

	The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

	1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

	The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

	(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

	Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
	numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

	Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
	natural numbers and the square of the sum.
